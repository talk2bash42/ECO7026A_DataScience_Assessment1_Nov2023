Weight: 30% of the module grade
Assessment Brief
This assessment entails performing typical data science tasks using Python. The tasks are designed to be accomplished using Python techniques covered in lectures and classes. However, you may use specific functions not covered in class if available in standard Python modules or modules already covered.

Evaluation Criteria:
Correctness: Code should run without errors and produce correct outputs.
Clarity: Code should be easy to understand, with appropriate use of comments.
Design: Code should be well-written, using Python features efficiently and avoiding repetition.
Instructions:
Use the provided Jupyter notebook template for your solutions.
Marks out of 100 are shown in square brackets.
All answers must be your original work.
Plagiarism will be treated as collusion.

Marking Criteria:
Excellent (First Class): Correct code applicable to any dataset, elegant use of Python features, clear documentation.
Good (2.1): Mostly correct code with minor errors, good use of Python, reasonably clear code structure.
Fair (2.2): Most features present but lacking in one aspect such as clarity or correctness.
Poor (3rd Class or Fail): Serious deficiencies in one or more criteria.
Submission:
Submit a single runnable Jupyter notebook file (.ipynb) on Blackboard by 17 November 2023 at 15:00 GMT.
Exercise Details
In behavioral economics, decisions are often influenced by "payoff-irrelevant" factors like naming, color, and layout. This exercise explores the phenomenon in the context of the "Friday the 13th" superstition, affecting birth rates.

Tasks:
Load data from provided files and verify values.
Summarize and visualize the data.
Analyze the "Friday the 13th" effect by comparing birth rates on Fridays falling on the 13th to other Fridays.
Compare datasets to determine if one systematically reports more births and if birth counts are correlated.
